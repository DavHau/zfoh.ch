  <p class="question">What is ZuriHac?</p>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> Hackathon
    in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
    coding festival organized by
    <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell</a>.
    It features fantastic keynotes, interesting tracks, and of course lots of
    hacking and socializing!
  </p>
  <p>
    ZuriHac takes place <strong>Friday 12 June — Sunday 14 June</strong> 2020.

      Holding an event for 500 people in a physical location is clearly
      not an option this year. Instead, we are happy to inform you that the hackathon
      will take place as an <strong>online event</strong>. Read on below for the details, we're
      very eager to tell you how we intend to make it into a great event.

  <p class="question">What will the online version look like?</p>
  <p>
    For the talks, we are streaming them live on
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2zfPMH_srjxUN5EYrfIhCw">YouTube</a>.
    We will even hold the usual
    Q&amp;A at the end, where our friendly moderators will pass your questions from
    the chat to the speaker.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the general hacking and socializing, we will be using
    <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a>. It provides both chat channels like Slack and IRC,
    as well as voice channels with optional video/screen sharing. This gives us an
    online space where we can:
    <ul>
      <li>Collaborate &amp; hack</li>
      <li>Provide classes and tracks</li>
      <li>Hold lightning talks</li>
      <li>Casually talk to each other and exchange ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    We also plan to host the
    <a href="#beginner-track">beginner</a> and
    <a href="#advanced-track">advanced</a> tracks online.
    More info about that will follow!
  </p>

  <p class="question">How do I attend?</p>
  <p>
    I'm glad you asked!

    You still need to <a href="/zurihac2020/#registration">register</a>, so that we can provide
    a good experience to everybody. If you're privacy minded, feel free to choose any username
    you want.
  </p>
  <p>
    After you register, you will find an invite link to our Discord server on your registration
    page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, make sure to head over to our <a href="/zurihac2020/projects.html">projects page</a>,
    and have a look at what interests you. If you submit your own project, we will even create a
    channel on Discord just for you!
  </p>

  <p class="question">But what about my T-Shirt?</p>
  <p>
    The economics of an online conference are very different from an on-site
    event, so we have decided to offer reimbursements to all our sponsors.
    This means we cannot offer any free T-Shirts this year.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, we've seen in our post-events surveys that a lot of people really
    like the T-Shirt!  That is why we have opened a webshop this year, so you
    can still get the ZuriHac swag you deserve.
  </p>
  <p class="raise">
    <a href="https://shop.zfoh.ch/" target="_blank">Take me to the webshop</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    All profits we make on these T-Shirts will be donated to a COVID-19 related
    charity.  Shipping may be slow due to the pandemic, and we are obviously
    also very new to selling items online, so please be patient.
