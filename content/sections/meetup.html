We'll go over the basics using our Haskeller goggles, mostly focusing on interactive experimenting and proof development.</p> <p>I will compare Agda and Coq, again mostly from practical, “UX” standpoint (though I'll say a few words about theoretical differences). And we'll do a bunch of toy examples, which will hopefully illuminate why functional programming has such a deep and intricate relationship with logic and proofs.</p> <p>The main goal is to give a taste of these two incredible Proof Assistants, get our hands dirty, and for anyone who gets interested to have a pointer to further resources.</p> <p>---</p> <p>I wrote some installation instructions for those of you who'd want to follow along but don't have Agda or Coq set up yet. I also created a Docker image with everything configured properly. The image is a bit heavy (1GB compressed), but is probably the fastest way to get going, and is very easy to clean up afterwards. ;)</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/nilcons/agda-coq-setup" class="linkified">https://github.com/nilcons/agda-coq-setup</a></p> <p>---</p> <p>This will be an online event.
