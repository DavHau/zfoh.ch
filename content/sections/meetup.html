The general assembly gives you the opportunity to learn what the association has been doing in the year 2021 and to contribute to ZuriHac, the HaskellerZ meetup, and the Haskell community in Zurich.</p> <p>This assembly marks the fourth year of the association. As in past years, the board and further volunteers have been working hard to keep the association and its events alive. The events had to be held online again last year due to COVID. Despite this, ZuriHac 2021 was a great success again! The HaskellerZ meetup on the other hand has suffered and we didnâ€™t have nearly as many meetups as planned. We need your help to keep them alive going forward!</p> <p>Unfortunately, it looks like we may find ourselves short on volunteers to continue the function of the Zurich Friends of Haskell association. Participating in the ZFoH is a great way to meet other Haskellers. You don't need to be an expert Haskeller to contribute, a bit of enthusiasm for Functional Programming is all that's required. If you are interested, then please fill in the following poll to indicate in which areas you would be interested to contribute: [<a href="https://forms.gle/Cv2BrdgU6vDReKuj7](https://forms.gle/Cv2BrdgU6vDReKuj7" class="linkified">https://forms.gle/Cv2BrdgU6vDReKuj7](https://forms.gle/Cv2BrdgU6vDReKuj7</a>)</p> <p>The general assembly is open to all members of the ZFoH. If you are not a member yet, please head over to[ <a href="https://zfoh.ch](https://zfoh.ch" class="linkified">https://zfoh.ch](https://zfoh.ch</a>) and sign up for membership.</p> <p>The agenda is as follows:</p> <p>1. The board will present a summary of the association's activities in 2021.<br/>2. The treasurer will present the financial report for 2021.<br/>3. We vote to discharge the board for their work in 2021.<br/>4. We will discuss the goals and aspirations of the association for 2021.<br/>5. We elect the board for the next two years.</p> <p>Note, members of the ZFoH will receive a separate invitation via email. Please RSVP to this meetup event anyway so we get an accurate picture of who will be attending. Thank you!</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you at the GA!</p> <p>\-\-\-</p> <p>This will be an online event due to COVID-19.
