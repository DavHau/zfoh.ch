It took a few hours and did the job. But then the job got larger. Eventually, implementing one feature would break something else. (Fortunately, I usually caught it, because, well, I had tests.) This was supposed to be fun, so I needed to find a way to return to quick delivery.</p> <p>After a while of tinkering, I settled on Haskell to implement the framework. It was an odd choice—it’s mostly I/O and exceptions—but the language really helped me work incrementally, with a very tight safety net.</p> <p>I’d like to show you some of the lessons I learned in porting the project from Ruby to Haskell, the upsides, and the downsides too. We’ll explore the trade-offs together, and hopefully this will be useful to you in deciding how to implement your next side project.</p> <p>---</p> <p>This will be an online event. We will be using Zoom for video conference and Slack for chat. The video will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube after the event.</p> <p>Please join the ZuriHac Slack workspace using the following link and then join the #meetup channel. <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/zurihac/shared_invite/zt-fze1zlwj-o9fyHNu1imfJTwHR5_ChOg" class="linkified">https://join.slack.com/t/zurihac/shared_invite/zt-fze1zlwj-o9fyHNu1imfJTwHR5_ChOg</a></p> <p>Please join the video conference using the following link.<br/><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/87071658675?pwd=SU1ZSTNDWE5TaHhlUmtnRlRacWY2UT09" class="linkified">https://us02web.zoom.us/j/87071658675?pwd=SU1ZSTNDWE5TaHhlUmtnRlRacWY2UT09</a><br/>Meeting ID:[masked]<br/>Password:[masked]</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/271009754/">Alexey Kuleshevich - Color in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/270704738/">Mihaly Barasz - Practical Intro to Agda and Coq</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/270136648/">Niklas Hambüchen - Asynchronous and Parallel Programming in Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/269475956/">Juri Chome &amp; Cazim Hysi - Workshop on building a webservice</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/268245453/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/267492326/">Marion Schleifer - Open source with Haskell</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/266267206/">Tom Sydney Kerckhove - Cooperative distributed agreement</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/265429171/">Roland Senn - The GHCi debugger</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/events/265048719/">Bring Your Own Coding Problem #4</a></li></ul></div></div>
